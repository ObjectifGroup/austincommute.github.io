A set of documents for downtown Austin employers to use to introduce various commute options to new employees.

# A Premise
I was listening to the Freakonomics podcast the other day<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>, discussing willpower and "temptation bundling". One of the big takeaways for me was that it's significantly harder for people to change in isolation. In terms of getting people to try alternative transportation options, lots of the effort I've seen is focused on changing existing employee behaivor.

I'm not saying that's wrong, but let's start simple. I want to create a set of documents (web site?) that employers can fork and tweak to their liking, to use for new employees *before* their first day of work. If HR sends out a "welcome packet" or such, this should be in it. 

A few initial goals, I think are appropriate:

- Present the wide variety of options and language that allows for different variations for what a company might offer (i.e. Car2Go explanation for someone not living in Austin, with language around whether or not a company subsidizes it)
- Clear writing that is well-intentioned. (See <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>)
- Prioritize best practices, so when companies are implementing this anew, they can potentially use it to guide decision-making in transportation benefits for their employees.

My hope is that this becomes a community-driven effort. I hope that in 2016 we see at least a few employers forking this repo, making modifications to their needs, and sending it out to new hires. And hopefully submitting pull requests for improvements and updates. 

I hope that those who are more technically-minded and comfortable with Github can help their companies navigate the waters. If you're in HR (and once we have something), find someone in your organization who is passionate about transportation. I promise they are there.
